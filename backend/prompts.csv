2408.00065,"""onstant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0.
Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such
as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle
rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy
with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar
models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258
as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W −F150W ) TRGB distances to 8 hosts
of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370,
NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence
of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen
variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips
to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but
this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.00 to 0.02 mag,
all consistent at 1σ with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and
Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST ar""
