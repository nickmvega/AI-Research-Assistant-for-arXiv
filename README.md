# INTRODUCTION

The AI Research Assistant for arXiv is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the process of retrieving and analyzing academic papers from the arXiv repository. This project leverages a React-based frontend to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input arXiv paper IDs and access the corresponding PDFs via a Flask-powered backend API. In addition to simply retrieving documents, the application integrates a fine-tuned language model, Llama 3.1, enabling users to ask questions and interactively explore the content of the papers, thus enhancing research efficiency and depth of analysis.

# COMING SOON

A fully deployed website will be coming very soon.
